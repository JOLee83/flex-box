        <h1>RESPONSIVE FLEXBOX LISTING</h1>
        <h3>Flexbox is an amazingly powerful layout tool.
          In this example I have created a responsive grid of
          articles that increased the amount of visible articles
          on the page at larger resolutions.</h3>

        <h1>Article Title Here</h1>
        <h4>by Bruce Wayne | Jan. 1st, 2018</h4>
        <p>Every man who has lotted here over the centuries,
        has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom.
        So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to
        seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died
        trying. And then here there can be no true despair without
        hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people
        hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that
        they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over
        each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture
        an entire city. And then when you've truly understood th
        depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's
        destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is
        done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission
        to die.</p>
        <p>No, no, no. A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble
        for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up.
        But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote
        yourself to an idel and if they can't stop you then you become
        something else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling
        with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue
        flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers.
        If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what
        you were looking for in the first place.</p>
        <p>Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick.
        You can't savor all the... little emotions. You see, in their
        last moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way,
        I knew your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to
        know which of them were cowards?</p>
        <p>I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a
        little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at
        a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't
        want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the
        fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't
        dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.</p>
        <p>But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger
        strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just
        poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing
        the person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your
        pain.</p>
