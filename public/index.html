          <p>Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has
          looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom.
          So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to
          seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died
          trying. And then here there can be no true despair without
          hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people
          hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that
          they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over
          each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture
          an entire city. And then when you've truly understood th
          depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's
          destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is
          done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission
          to die.</p>

          <p>You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was...
          a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off
          crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend
          herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me watching
          he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He
          turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?". He comes at me
          with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my
          mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face." and...
          Why so serious?</p>

          <p>Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence, this
          cafe on the banks of the Arno. Every fine evening, I would
          sit there and order a Fernet Branca. I had this fantasy,
          that I would look across the tables and I would see you
          there with a wife maybe a couple of kids. You wouldn't say
          anything to me, nor me to you. But we would both know that
          you've made it, that you were happy. I never wanted you to
          come back to Gotham. I always knew there was nothing here
          for you except pain and tragedy and I wanted something more
          for you than that. I still do.</p>

          <p>Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you
          must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men.
          And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become
          a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea!
          Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort.
          To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace
          your worst fear. Become one with the darkness.</p>

          <p>You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was
          beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells
          me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the
          sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money
          for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile
          again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.
          So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the
          sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm
          always smiling.</p>

          <p>My name is Merely Ducard but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...
          a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A mon who
          can offer you a path. Someone like you is only here by choice.
          You have been exploring the criminal fraternity but whatever
          your original intentions you have to become truly lost. The
          path of a man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to
